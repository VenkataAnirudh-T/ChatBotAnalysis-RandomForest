6,Bot,7,We sincerely apologize for the mistake made and the harm it has caused. We will process a refund and also would like to offer you a 10$ credit that you may use later.
6,Joe,8,"This is a really bad service and one not expected from a store like yours. This problem must be taken to the managers notice. Connect me to your manager before other people get harmed, I need to alert higher authorities to immediately stop the sale of those products."

7,Bot,1,"Hello Jimmy, this is Chap. How may I help you?"
7,Jimmy,2,I need help with an error when trying to use one of your applications feature.
7,Bot,3,"Sure, can you please state what the error says?"
7,Jimmy,4,It says index out of memory and the application crashes.
7,Bot,5,"Oh, that looks as though your systems RAM is too small for the operation."
7,Jimmy,6,"At first I did feel the same, but I moved the application onto a remote servers that hve 48Giggs memory. Which seems more the sufficient and I still see the same error."
7,Bot,7,What is the operation that you are trying to perform?
7,Jimmy,8,I am trying to export the data on screen to an excel using the excel export button.
7,Bot,9,That is a rather simple function and should not take much memory. There seems to be a problem with your computer.
7,Jimmy,10,"NO, the problem is not with my computer. You are wrong, as I have ran it on the server as well, but the issue is still on."
7,Bot,11,It makes me think there might be a malware attack or issue with excel plugin itself.
7,Jimmy,12,"I am done with this, at your customer service you keep doing the blame game as usual. Never accept mistakes. This is the second time in a row that I am getting this bad response from you guys. I want to unsubscribe the license and discourage others from using your products for the kind of service you are providing."
8,Bot,1,"Hello Mike, this is Bot. How can I help you?"
8,Mike,2,"Hello Bot, I need to replace the automatic irobot home vacuum that I purchased the other day."
8,Bot,3,"Sure, can you please state why you would want a replacement."
8,Mike,4,"On its first run, it went straight crashing into the wall without automatically sensing and it now has a crack on the sides."
8,Bot,5,"Are you sure crack was due to the fault in the vacuum, or was it broken before that?"
8,Mike,6,"I think it was fine when we purchased, it broke after its's first run"
8,Bot,7,"I am afraid in that case, there isn’t really much we can do about this. As the product is under manufacturers warrant and not retailer."
8,Mike,8,I am unhappy with the kind of support I am getting for a premium membership. This is a substandard assistance.
8,Bot,9,"We apologize, under premium membership, there are policies that need to be followed. Under the circumstance that you have mentioned, we unable to return or refund."
8,Mike,10,It is very unfair and disappointing.

10,Bot,5,"I understand your concer. I wouldn’t want any customers gift to arrive late either.It looks like your order is set to arrive in 2 business days, so it should arrive by Friday, just in time! Is there anything else that I can do for you?"

11,Bot,1,"Hi Stark , how may I help you?"
11,Stark,2,I have a query regarding my order
11,Bot,3,Yes I can help you. Could you please share me your order id 
11,Stark,4,Yup here is my order Id 123456789
11,Bot,5,give me a moment I will have your details up on the screen.
11,Bot,6,here it goes am able see the order placed on may 1st.
11,Bot,7,So may I know whats the query about?
11,Stark,8,in the  same order I have added 2 lb of tomatoes.
11,Stark,9,when I received the order today from the looks of it I see that they are going to rott in next 1 or 2 days 
11,Stark,10,It is quite annoying when you send low quality products in general when I make a online delivery order
11,Bot,11,We sincerely appologise for the inconvinence caused.
11,Bot,12,I could give you refund in two ways. Would you like the credit in your insta account or your original payment mode
11,Stark,13,I would like to have it refund back to my bank account. 
11,Stark,14,I would certainly like to see an improvement in the next order
11,Bot,15,We will take this incident to the concerned official and make sure to improve the next time.
11,Bot,16,Is there anything else I could help you with?
11,Stark,17,"Yes , There is also another problem with the order. I see that I have received two shampoos where as I added only one to my cart. "
11,Stark,18,I would like to return it back and would want a refund on that as well.
11,Bot,19,But on my screen it shows that you have placed 2 quantites of shampoo.
11,Bot,20,I am afraid I cannot initiate the process of refund on this product. You would have to manually go to the store and return in the store.
11,Stark,21,I ordered only one shampoo but got two I don’t know why. I suppose there is some issue with the system and its not my mistake.
11,Stark,22,I don’t have any stores near by that’s the reason I placed order for online delivery
11,Stark,23,"it also disappoints me because of the kind of impression it leaves, being my first order."
11,Bot,24,I am really sorry but we are helpless. Would you want to get in touch with my store manager and explain him. 
11,Stark,25,Will that be of any help? Or will it also be a lost cause because I have to talk to him and explain him  the entire scenario. Which I feel is frustrating.
11,Bot,26,I am sure he will be able to help you with your problem.
11,Stark,27,Alright go ahead connect me with him
12,Bot,1,How can I help you today
